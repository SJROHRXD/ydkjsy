## YDKJSY - Second Edition ##

Examine how JavaScript works. Even the ugly parts.

Ask "why" for every line of code you write.

"I don't think it's possible to ever fully know JS. That's not an achievement to be obtained, but a goal to strive after. You don't finish knowing everything about JS, you just keep learning more and more as you spend more time with the language. And the deeper you go, the more you revisit what you knew before, and you re-learn it from that more experienced perspective."

Read one chapter beginning to end, then go back and read section by section.

Practice the code from individual sections, gaining comfortability w/ the presented concepts.
